## Blackjack

Play command-line Blackjack. Nightmare is only in the name because of the assignment difficulty level in which nightmare is the most difficult.

### How to play
Run *ruby blackjack_nightmare.rb* on the command line.

You'll enter your first and second card, the dealer's top card and the number of decks, after which you'll be suggested to 'Hit' or 'Stand'.

If suggested to 'Stand' or 'Split', the program ends.

If you choose to 'Hit', you'll be asked for your next received (so to speak) card.

If you have a Blackjack winning hand, you win.

Good luck!
